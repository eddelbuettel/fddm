This folder contains all of the code used to produce the results (i.e., images) in the fddm paper.

images contains all of the plots that are used in the paper.

section_3 contains all of the code and images used in Section 3 of the paper "Approximations to the DDM Density Functions".

section_5 contains all of the code and images used in Section 5 of the paper "Benchmark Testing".

appendices contains all of the code and benchmark data used in the appendices (specifically the one about the additional analysis)

extra_analysis contains some other perhaps useful code and images. Mainly it compares the max_terms_large parameter in the dfddm function (to do with the SWSE combined-time algorithm).
